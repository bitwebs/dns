# üëã Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to contribute üëç ‚àí You can help out in various ways:

- **Questions:** You are welcome to post questions as [issues][], but you can also - more casually - join us in our [discord][] chat!
- **Publicity:** Writings about this project (documentation, tutorials, etc.) - or even Videos üò± - are super awesome and if you have something please let us know _(see above)_ so it can be linked to and we can give credits! (starring the github project is nice too!)
- **Code:** See below. 
- _Money_: You can help out with money too, contributions to the [dat open collective][] or sponsoring [Martin on Github][] would be nice!

### About Code Contributions

Please send code contributions through the github [PR][] system.
Contributions are always welcome, but it helps to know what thoughts went into the [architecture][] and that you are familiar with the [API][].

A CI task will run the `npm` scripts: `lint`, `coverage` and `test-browser` against your code. We can not merge requests without them passing.

Currently we have ~100% code coverage, which doesn't mean too much but if possible it would be great to continue that practice.
